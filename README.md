## what is anchor-go?

`anchor-go` generates Go clients for [Solana](https://solana.com/) programs (smart contracts) written using the [anchor](https://github.com/solana-foundation/anchor) framework.

It reads the [IDL](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/basics/idl) (Interface Definition Language) file generated by anchor and produces Go code that can be used to interact with the program and its data structures.
